data$country <- as.factor(data$country)

formula <- country ~ gold + silver + bronze

default_priors <- get_prior(formula, data = data, family = categorical())

print(default_priors)

model <- brm(
  formula = formula,
  data = data,
  family = categorical(),  
  prior = default_priors,
  chains = 4,
